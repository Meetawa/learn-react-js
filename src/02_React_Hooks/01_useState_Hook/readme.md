# useState :

- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
- State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
- useState lets you use local state within a function component. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
