# Lists and Keys

- In React, you will render lists with some type of loop.
- Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

- This code logs [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console.

- In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.

# Rendering Multiple Components

- You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

- Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```

- Then, we can include the entire listItems array inside a <ul> element:

```
<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```

# Basic List Component

- Usually you would render lists inside a component.

- We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of numbers and outputs a list of elements.

```
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<NumberList numbers={numbers} />);
```

- When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We’ll discuss why it’s important in the next section.

- Let’s assign a key to our list items inside numbers.map() and fix the missing key issue.

```
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
```
