# What is Component?

- Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

- Components come in two types, Class components and Function components

## Function Components

- A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

Example :

- Create a Function component called Car

```diff
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
```

so,Header,Content,Footer are react components where we defined my function inside.
